# Invaderz
Collaborative Project



Invaderz is a computer game that resembles the game mechanics of space invaders with different types of invaders and a tank instead of a spaceship. The program was made by a team 4 developers with different level of experience but mainly they focued mostly in the front-end while I developed the back-end. 

Mainly I was responsible of developing a UML diagram to ensure low coupling and high cohesion and to adhere to an Object Oriented Design. I was also in charge of coding moslty the methods in the model folder and had to fully test them in JUnit to ensure the program functionality.

We mainly worked remotely, as so we used a server that my university lets us use. We mainly shared, stored and changed all files directly through the server. To facilitate this we used Cyberduck. 

If you desire to know more about this project please let me know.
